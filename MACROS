The syscall() macro should be invoked as follows:
	syscall(#,arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5,arg6)

Error checking is built into the macro. You _MUST_ define an error-handler.
If the syscall() macro is invoked without an error handler defined, the
assembler will throw an error.

You define error handlers like this:

ech(label_for_your_error_code)
; do shit
ech(other_label_for_stuff)

The error checking consists of:
	or rax,rax
	js @ERROR_HANDLER
So, the FLAGS are set based on the error return of the syscall, which is nice.

If for some reason you don't want error checking, you can do that like this:
%undef __syserror_handler
; do un-error-checked stuff
ech(whatever)
You'll get a warning during assembly for every non-error-checked syscall()

Do remember that if you don't define an error-handler at the beginning of a
file, you'll just inherit the last definition from the previous file, which
is probably not what you want. Even if it is, ech() is an assemble-time macro,
so there's no real detriment to redefining it at the beginning of every file.
This is also good in case files get re-ordered in master.asm.

The arguments are loaded with 32-bit 'mov' by default.
You can change that in the following ways:
	+arg	: Load arg with a 64-bit 'mov'
	^arg	: Load arg with a 32-bit 'mov' (redundant in this usage)
	^^arg	: Load arg with a 16-bit 'mov'
	^^^arg	: Load arg with an 8-bit 'mov'
	[arg]	: Load arg with 'lea' (eg, "lea rdi,[arg]")
	+[arg]	: Dereference arg and load (eg, "mov rdi,[arg]")
	^[arg]
	^^[arg]
	^^^[arg]
	[+arg]	: Discard brackets and load with 'mov' (eg, "mov rdi,arg")
	[^arg]	  (This functionality is stupid, and is likely to be removed soon)
	[^^arg]
	[^^^arg]
	NULL	: Make the argument NULL (Always 64-bit, eg "xor rdi,rdi")
	(blank) : Don't do anything for that argument (as arg2 in, "syscall(#,arg1,,arg3)"
Note that the syscall number ("#" in the example) is also expanded in this fashion

In our thread-based model, each thread calls mmap() to grab it's own memory,
and sets %rbp the base of that memory.

The tmalloc(symbol,$bytes) macro "reserves" space in that memory. It defines
'symbol' to be [rbp+bytes].

So, for example:

tmalloc(crap,8)
tmalloc(shit,16)
tmalloc(moreshit,32)

crap is "rbp"
shit is "rbp+8"
moreshit is "rbp+24"

This is fantastic for several reasons:
	1) We get to refer to these things by name, instead of offsets of rbp
	2) If we decide to add something later that needs memory, we can just
	   add a tmalloc() for it, and everything else will magically be adjusted
	3) We can make mmap() allocate the thread block based on how much we tmalloc()

It's a little confusing, because it looks like malloc() but is a macro... but it's
easy enough to understand, and you rarely if ever have to treat the resulting labels
any differently than if they were defined in .data
