asmhttpd - The tiniest webserver ever written
================================================================================
HOW TO BUILD:
-------------
	Just run "make". You will need NASM on your system.

HOW TO RUN:
-----------
	sudo ./asmhttpd "/path/to/your/webroot"

FAQ:
----
	Q: Why?
	A: Just for fun, this is obviously completely impractical.

	Q: How tiny is it?
	A: The core of the daemon uses one single page of memory (4KB). It is
	   quite literally impossible for a program to use less memory than
	   this one does. Each connection allocates an additional 4KB.

	Q: Why do you use a thread-based model for serving files?
	A: Because it was substantially easier to write that way.

	Q: Why do you use NASM?
	A: It was what I was familiar with when I wrote it. NASM is actually a
	   great little assembler, but the Intel syntax is a drag.

REPORTING BUGS:
---------------
	Bug reports are greatly appreciated! The most useful information is the
	line that probably got printed in `dmesg`, which shows the address of
	the instruction which caused the segfault. Core dumps are not of much
	use, but send them if you have them. If the bug doesn't crash the
	daemon, send me a very detailed description of what you did to cause
	the issue.
