asmhttpd - The tiniest webserver ever written

HOW TO BUILD:
-------------

	Just run "make". You will need NASM on your system.

HOW TO RUN:
-----------

	./asmhttpd /path/to/your/webroot
	sudo ./asmhttpd /path/to/your/webroot

If run as root, it will listen on port 80. Otherwise, it will use port 8080.

HOW TINY IS IT?
---------------

The entire text and data can fit on a single 4K page:

  asmhttpd:     file format elf64-x86-64
  0 .text         00000692  0000000000401000  0000000000401000  00001000  2**4
  1 .rodata       000001b6  0000000000402000  0000000000402000  00002000  2**2

...but how many pages the program actually uses in practice depends. Generally,
you'll have a non-executable page for .rodata and an executable page for .text,
something like this:

  00401000-00402000 r-xp 00001000 00:16 2240409 asmhttpd
  00402000-00403000 r--p 00002000 00:16 2240409 asmhttpd

The code could be rewritten to pack itself into one page at runtime. Each client
currently consumes one additional 4K page.
